| TABLE OF CONTENTS |
| :-------------- |

| [Configuring AWS Amplify](#configuring-aws-amplify) |
| [Using Access Token with JWT Server Side](#using-access-token-with-jwt-server-side) |


## Configuring AWS Cognito

To configure the web application with login and signup features, we used AWS Cognito user pools. Using a user pool ID, I created a user account. Here are some of the key configurations I made for the account:

- Used email address for username sign in option.
- Enabled self-service so the user can reset their own password if recovery is needed. 
- Disabled Cognito Hosted UI as we are using our web application's UI.
- Enabled pulbic app client to call unauthenticated API operations.
