# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

This week was my first time using containirzation. As something breifly touched on when I was studying for the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam, I was looking forward to getting hands on with this concept using Docker. The tasks I completed for this weeks homeworks are listed in the table below.

Created a new Docker file in the the backend-flask folder by naming it Dockerfile.
